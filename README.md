# SMTP-MailClient
“smtplib” creates a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol client session object which is used to send emails to any valid email id on the internet. Different websites use different port numbers.
I am using a Gmail account to send a mail. Port number used here is ‘587’. And if you want to send mail using a website other than Gmail, you need to get smtp url for that website.
